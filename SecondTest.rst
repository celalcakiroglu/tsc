The focus of the second tensile strain experiment is the effect of internal pressure on the tensile strain capacity of the pipe. The tensile strain that the pipe experiences due to internal pressure and applied tensile displacement is measured using strain gauges and digital image correlation. The white painted and speckled areas in Figure(:ref:`Specimen2`) are the areas where the strain field is captured throughout the experiment using digital image correlation. The white area in the middle of the pipe is where the girth weld and the heat affected zone (HAZ) are located. The flaw is cut in the HAZ within 5 mm from the girth weld. 

In addition to digital image correlation, 19 strain gauges are mounted on different parts of the pipe surface. Since the cameras are not high enough to take pictures of the upper parts of the pipe, in these parts the strain values are measured using strain gauges. Also at the mid-sections of both upper and lower parts of the pipe two rings of strain gauges are mounted in longitudinal and hoop directions.
