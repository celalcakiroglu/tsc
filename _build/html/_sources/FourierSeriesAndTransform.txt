Fourier Series and the Fourier Transform
==================================================

Fourier Series
---------------------------
The Fourier series representation of a periodic signal :math:`x(n)` is defined as

.. math:: x(n)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}c_k e^{j2\pi kn/N}

where :math:`N` is the fundamental period of :math:`x(n)`
