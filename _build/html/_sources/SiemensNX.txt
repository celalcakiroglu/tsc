3D Modeling Tutorials
=====================================
In this section different 3D modeling techniques are presented using Siemens NX 8.0/10.0. 

The most common way of creating a 3D object is to extrude a base geometry drawn on a plane.

Intersection of a Datum Plane with an Extruded Body (8.0)
----------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to define new curves by the intersection of datum planes with extruded bodies.
After defining the datum plane we can open a sketch on the datum plane. Afterwards we can use the "Intersection Curve" button in the direct Sketch Toolbar: Here we must have the "Intersection Curve" button activated. The rest is simple. 
Also typing "Intersect" in the "Command Finder" helps. The "Command Finder" is by default in the menubar of the program on the right hand side of "Redo".

To switch between different modules of the program like "Modeling" and "NX Sheet Metal" the **Start** button at the upper left corner, right below "File" can be used.

Mirroring of curves created by intersection of datum planes and extruded bodies(8.0)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a function called "Mirror curve" which is hidden by default. In order to make this function available:  

- Step 1: Right click on the "Insert" menu.
- Step 2: Put a check mark on the left hand side of "Curve"
- Step 3: The curve toolbar appears. Click on Toolbar options -> Add or remove buttons -> Curve
- Step 4: Put a check mark on the left hand side of "Mirror Curve". 

The "Intersection Curve" and "Mirror Curve" commands can be added to the menubar by dragging the toolbar that shows up after the 4th step above into the menubar.

Assigning Different Colors To Different Partitions of a Body (8.0)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This can be achieved using "Split Body" from the Trim drop-down (second toolbar row, 6th drop-down from the left).

Changing the Background Color of the Model (8.0)
-----------------------------------------------------

Preferences -> Color Palette -> Selected Color -> Edit Background

Making a Part Transparent (10.0)
---------------------------------

- Step 1: Go to the "View" menu at the top
- Step 2: Click on "Edit Object Display" in the "View" menu
- Step 3: Select the part that you want to make transparent
- Step 4: Click "OK"
- Step 5: Adjust the value of "Translucency" under "Shaded Display"
