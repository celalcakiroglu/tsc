Biography of Celal Cakiroglu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Celal was born in 1985 in Istanbul. In the early years of his life he was introduced to the game of chess. After a while it turned out that he was good at this game. However he followed the advice of his parents to concentrate on the high school entrance exams and didn't pursue a chess carrier. He attended the German high school of Istanbul (Istanbul Erkek Lisesi) between 1995 and 2003. Afterwards he attended the civil engineering program in Istanbul Technical University. During this time Celal got interested in the simulation of structural engineering systems and related software development. In the scope of his bachelor's thesis he contributed to the development of a basic level finite element simulation program. Afterwards he went to Braunschweig for studying in the master's program "Computational Sciences in Engineering".    
In his free time he reads science fiction novels like Frank Herbert's Dune or Asimov's Foundation. He still plays chess sometimes too.
