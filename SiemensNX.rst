Intersection of a Datum Plane with an Extruded Body
----------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to define new curves by the intersection of datum planes with extruded bodies.
After defining the datum plane we can open a sketch on the datum plane. Afterwards we can use the "Intersection Curve" button in the 
direct Sketch Toolbar: Here we must have the "Intersection Curve" button activated. The rest is simple. 
Also typing "Intersect" in the commandfinder helps.
